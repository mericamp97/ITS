Our website streamlines travel planning for salespeople by enabling automatic travel itinerary creation between meetings. Users simply import their calendar in popular formats, such as ICS, and select their preferred transportation mode with a single click. The system then calculates travel times, schedules necessary travel entries including departure and arrival times and alerts users if they will arrive late to certain meetings. The updated calendar, exportable in ICS format, seamlessly integrates back into users' preferred calendar applications such as Google Calendar. 

The main features of ITS are the following:

1. Seamless importation of an existing calendar in popular formats, such as ICS.
2. Calculation of departure and arrival times between meetings based on the user's desired mode of transportation.
3. Creation of calendar entries for travel and notify the users if a certain travel itinerary will clash with other calendar entries.
4. Exportation of either the whole calendar or just the travel itineraries in popular formats, such as ICS, for seamless integration back into the user's favorite calendar application.
